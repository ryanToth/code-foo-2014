My first course of action when trying to solve this problem was simply googling the question and seeing what pops up. Unfortunately I found that this is not a statistic that is held and I would would have to take another approach. 
</li>
<BR>

My next thought was to define what a gamer is to make sure any subsequent information I found on this topic is counting the correct group of people. <A HREF = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gamer > The Merriam Webster Dictionary</A> entry states that a gamer is a person who plays games; especially: a person who regularly plays computer or video games. This now lead me to find a definition for the word, regularly, to further increase my understanding of which people I am actually counting. 
</li>
<BR>
<li>
Regularly is defined in the <A HREF = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/regularly > The Merriam Webster Dictionary</A> as very often or on a regular basis. This definition was not particularly helpful so I chose to keep the word regularly as my word to define how often one needs to play games in order to be considered a gamer.
</li>
<BR>
<li>
The next step was to try and find out how many gamers there are in the United States.I found an interesting study done by <A HREF = http://www.theesa.com/facts/pdfs/esa_ef_2013.pdf> the Entertainment Software Association</A> that showed that 58 percent of Americans play video games. From that it would have been easy to simply take 58 percent of the San Francisco Bay Areas population and say that is the total number of gamers in the area but there are also demographics of who these gamers actually are. Since it is more than likely that the Bay Areas demographics is not identical to the entire United States, it would be unfair to simply generalize the area as such.
</li>
<BR>
<li>
My next step was to break down the demographic of the Bay Area and compare that to the statistics provided by the Entertainment Software Association to get a more accurate representation of all of the gamers in the area. The best breakdown I could get from the gamers study was that The breakdown of people in america who are gamers gender is as follows: 
<ul>
<li>
Women: 52 percent
</li>
<li>
Men: 64 percent
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<BR>
<li>
Now by multiplying the percent of total gamers in the United States by the breakdown of each gender, I can find out what percent of americans in each gender category are gamers. I can then multiply these percents by the corresponding demographics population in the San Francisco Bay Area, add the numbers together and get a decent estimate as to the number of gamers. Using the <A HREF = http://www.bayareacensus.ca.gov/bayarea.htm> Bay Area Census</a> for 2010, I found that the number of people of each gender is:
<ul>
<li>
Women: 3,606,831
</li>
<li>
Men: 3,543,908
</li>
</ul>
By multiplying these populations by the percentages of them that statistically are gamers I get a total of 4,143,653 gamers in the Bay Area, 1,875,552 being women and 2,268,101 being men
</li>
<BR>
</ol>
I realize that I did not end up using my definition of what a gamer actually is during my actual calculations but I had thought earlier that I may need the information but it had turned out that I did not.
