IGN's Code-Foo 2014
=============

My name is Ryan Toth, I am finishing my second year of software engineering at the University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario and I am applying for a position in IGN's Code-Foo-2014. 

Question #1: Code Foo Application Video,
Question #2: Gamers_In_San_Fran.html,
Question #3: crossword folder,
Question #4: N/A,
Question #5: pacman folder,
Question #6: Pokedex folder and shooter folder (shooter is the Galaga-like game I mentioned in my intro video)

UPDATE: Just recently tested the .jar files on a PC and noticed that they do not perform as well as some aspects of the codes seem to be missing/not working properly. For best results run on a mac. I am sorry if this has caused any confusion.
