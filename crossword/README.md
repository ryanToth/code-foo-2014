Question #3: This is my crossword genertaing code written in Java. It is bare bones to show its funtionality. It works
by simply outputting the completed crossword to the console. It reads .txt files in a format like in the crossword.txt file 
provided and randomly selecting words from that file to arrange in a configuration that works. It is a simple crossword such 
that there must be at least one space between words of the same orientation. It runs until it can no longer place more words 
from the .txt file into the crossword.
