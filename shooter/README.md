Here is the Galaga-like Game I mentioned in my video, I thought I might as well upload it since I mentioned it. I know I'm posting this a while after the application deadline but I thought it wouldn't hurt to get it out there. I did not make nor do I own any of the sprites or backgorunds that I used in the game, I only modified a few images I found in order simulate a little bit of animation. Use the arrow keys to move Goku around, press the space bar to shoot the magikarp. If you hold the space bar, you will see the charging meter fill. Once it is full, you can release the space bar to shoot a charged shot which does not disappear after hitting an enemy, it also does extra damage against gyrados. Gyrados appears for a boss fight on every 5th wave.To play the game, open up the "Goku VS The Karp" .jar file.  

UPDATE: Pause now works (press p). There is also a volatile high score system. I had plans for a non-volatile one but I did not end up finishing it, thereofor the "Rest High Score Button" that is on the start up window does nothing. It is just there in case I go back to finish up that feature. A few visual tweaks as well but nothing big.
