Question #6: This is a pokedex like app developed with some help from one of my professors for one of my classes. It has data about all 718 pokemon and supports, to some extent, 9 different languages. It was written using the QNX Momentics IDE and can only run on a Blackberry Z10 device or a virtual machine running its OS. It also has an awkward 7 second load time at start up and when “All Types” is selected. This is from the nature of the class project requiring the use of multiple .cvs files acquired form GitHub. To change the langueage of the app, put your finger or mouse off the top of the screen and drag down, Japanese and English are the languages supported best.
